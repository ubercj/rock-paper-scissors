This is the second project in The Odin Project's Fundamentals curriculum.

The goal is to create a simple rock-paper-scissors program that runs in the JavaScript console.

After that, as a later part of the curriculum, I went back and used DOM manipulation to add a basic UI to the game, as well as change all of the console messages to appear on the actual page itself.
