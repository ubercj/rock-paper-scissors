This is the second project in The Odin Project's Fundamentals curriculum.

The goal is to create a simple rock-paper-scissors program that runs in the JavaScript console.

After that, I created another program that also keeps score and lets you play a best-of-5 match against the computer.

It was all supposed to be the same file, but I made a second one for the second part because I was afraid of messing up the original code and losing my work.
